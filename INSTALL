REQUIREMENTS

  To build, this code requires a Fortran 90 compiler and a working installation
  of BLAS and LAPACK.

COMPILING

  If the Fortran 90 compiler, BLAS and LAPACK are accessible in the default
  search directories, a simple
  
    ./configure
    make
    make install

  should be sufficient. One should try this first to see if it works. 

  By default, it will install into /usr/local/. The Fortran compiler,
  installation path, library paths, etc. can be specified with options passed to
  ./configure; run

    ./configure --help

  for more info.

INTEL MATH KERNEL LIBRARY (MKL)

  If you are using the Intel Math Kernel Library (MKL), or another BLAS/LAPACK
  library which is not being found by ./configure, include it using the LIBS and
  FFLAGS environment variables. E.g. for MKL 10.3:

    source /opt/intel/composerxe/bin/compilervars.sh intel64
    export LIBS="-L${MKLROOT}/lib/intel64 -lmkl_intel_lp64 -lmkl_sequential -lmkl_core -lpthread -lm"
    export FFLAGS="-I${MKLROOT}/include"
    ./configure

  The LIBS and FFLAGS values for MKL can be determined using the Intel Link Line
  advisor, available at:
