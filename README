pfit: A simple command-line polynomial fitting utility
Christopher N. Gilbreth, 2013, 2017

To compile, edit make.inc to specify your compiler and LAPACK library.

If you're using a Mac, LAPACK is already installed -- see the make.inc file.
On Linux, you can probably install ATLAS.

To use, type pfit -h and read the help message.
